* Give one example of a Gettier case.

A Gettier case is an example of justified true belief that is not knowledge, specifically one that relies on two pieces of information unknown to the believer that cancel each other out. Here is an example of a Gettier case. I believe that my house keys are in my pocket. My house keys are indeed in my pocket. I am justified in believing they are in my pocket, since I always keep them there, and remember putting them there after unlocking my front door last night, which was also the last time that I took them out. My belief that my keys are in my pocket is a justified true belief. However, it is not knowledge, because in fact my keys fell out of my pocket when I undressed for bed. But my partner found them on coming to bed later, put them back in my pocket, and did not mention it to me, for whatever reason (I was asleep at the time).
