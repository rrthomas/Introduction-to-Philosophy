* Why do brain transplant cases seem to cause problems for animalism?

Animalism says that human people are each numerically identical with a human animal. Brain transplants seem to pose a problem for this claim, as follows. Suppose there are two humans, Aleph and Beth. Beth dies from brain cancer, and their brain is removed. Aleph has multiple organ failure, and their healthy brain is transplanted into Beth’s body, and revived. Call this person Aleth. Aleth has Aleph’s personality and memory: they are psychologically continuous with Aleph. Intuitively, we might like to say Aleth /is/ Aleph. But in that case, Aleph gets a new body, while Aleph’s animal does not, so Aleph is not the same as Aleph’s animal. The animalist has to say that Aleph does not survive, so Aleth is /not/ Aleph, or say that Aleph’s animal somehow “comes with” Aleph’s brain, so that Aleth is the same animal as Aleph (“accidental animalism” or “psychological animalism”). Neither alternative seems satisfactory.
